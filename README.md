# Bike-Utah-Bill-Tracker

A bill tracker for Bike Utah.

TODO

- when in admin page, set up route for post and publish method to update the bill list.

- add the delete funcitonality as well for bill list.

Need to do for next time

- Add data validation
- add erroring for mispelled bills. Like if a bill name is mispelled and the request can't be completed, I want the rest of the bills to be updated except for the one that doesn't exist.
- password login for the admin stored on the .env file.
- Need to figure out a way to retrieve the names of the sponsors. Maybe a legistlature db.
